# ElmStarter

This repo contains the starter I use for [Elm][1] projects, using [Webpack][2].
It's based on [Elm Webpack Starter][3], updated for Webpack 2 and with some
other stuff I find useful like [Webpack Dashboard][4] and [elm-css][5]. There's
other stuff I plan to add in the future, like support for testing.

The repo is currently undocumented, because it's created primarily for my own
use. If you find it useful, please let me know! I'll be happy to answer any
questions and accept suggestions and/or pull requests.
